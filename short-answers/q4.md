1. 200 - This means whatever type of request we made was successful.

2. 404 - This status code means that the resource we were trying to `fetch` could not be located on the server.

3. 500 - This status code means the server encountered something unexpected. It is usually when the other 5xx errors couldn't apply to error it encountered.
