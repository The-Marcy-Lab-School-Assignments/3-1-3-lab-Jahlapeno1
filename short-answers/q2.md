# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer

The "Request/Response Cycle" is how two computers communicate using HTTP protocol. The client is the one sending the request and the server is the one sending the response. A server waits for a request in order to respond therefore it can't send request on it's own.
