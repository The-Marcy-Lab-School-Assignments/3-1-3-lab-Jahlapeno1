# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer

1. Functions and variables are scoped to the module they are in. This way, we can have variables with the same name in different modules that won't conflict with each other.

2. Code from different files can be exported to other files making them reusable and organized.
