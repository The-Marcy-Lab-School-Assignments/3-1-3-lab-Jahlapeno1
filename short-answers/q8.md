# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer

Using semantic elements means to use tags that clearly define the content in them. For example, `<header>`, `<form>` and `footer` describe what is in the tag. A non-semantic tag would be `<div>` or `<span>`.
