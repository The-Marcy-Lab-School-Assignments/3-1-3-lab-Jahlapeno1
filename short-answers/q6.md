# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer

Both `element.append()` and `element.appendChild()` inserts a node after the last child of the element. `.append()` can insert multiple nodes while `.appendChild` can only insert one node.

Keep in mind that .append also can append text strings while appendChild can only append nodes.
